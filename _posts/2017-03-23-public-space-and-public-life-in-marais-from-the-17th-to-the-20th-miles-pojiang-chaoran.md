  Public Space and Public Life in Marais (From the 17th to the
  20th)-Miles-Pojiang-Chaoran
---
Le Marais is a historic district in Paris, France. From mid-13th century to the 17th century, the Marais was the French nobility's favorite place of residence. After the French Revolution, the district was no more the aristocratic district it once was during the 17th and 18th centuries. Because of this, the district became a popular and active commercial area, hosting one of Paris' main Jewish communities. And recently itâ€™s become more of a gay neighborhood and a hip area for shopping, design, arts. The Place des Vosges is the oldest planned square in Paris and one of the finest in the city, which witness the transformation of the history in Le Marais from the 17th century to 19th century. So In this exercise we choose to tell the story about it and  explore it from the bird view map, perpectives and its facade in the photos taken in different ages. Through looking at the form of The Place des Vosges in the different ages and the public activities happened in the correspondent time, we would like to help the visitors to have a better understand of how the public space and the public life have transited through the time in Marais from the 17th century to the 20th century. 

1 We create the collections in a chronological way and put the photos which reflect the history, function, form and activities in that period in each one.we are not only presenting the form of public space but also citizens' activities and behaviors took place inside it. These collections can give visitors the knowledge of how the urban space and the related urban activities transformed over time. 

For instance, from these photos, we can see the Place des Vosges in 17th century is a true square which embodied the first European program of royal city planning. In 18th century, the green lands were designed and it was often the place for the nobility to meet and chat. After the French Revolution, the Place des Vosges became a place more civilian.
