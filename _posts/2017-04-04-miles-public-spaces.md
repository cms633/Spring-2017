## "Shakespeare Unauthorized," Boston Public Library

The “Shakespeare Unauthorized” exhibition at BPL uses the library’s own holdings to unsettle its visitors’ assumptions about supposed common knowledge concerning Shakespeare and his writing, by illustrating the contingencies of the texts and their reception. The very first room sets up this point brilliantly, by printing, in large type on perpendicular panels, two versions of what is arguably Shakespeare’s most famous line: “To be or not to be? I there’s the point” or “To be or not to be? That is the question.” The first version is immediately confusing, until the visitor approaches the case and looks at the competing editions that lead to these discrepancies. The arrangement itself contributes to the effect, as the print is stretched on canvas over a frame of 2x4s held down by sandbags: a mock version of skeletal stage scaffolding made to feel temporary and subject to alterations.(1) We realize quickly that, because Shakespeare’s plays were written for rapid performance runs, the texts were usually in flux, and we cannot be sure of the authorship of the versions we now read.

The space available to the BPL for this exhibition is quite small, so the canvas-based walls serve the second function of creating small rooms efficiently. In general, the draw of the exhibition is the collection of historical objects: varied editions, music scores, schemas drawn up by fans and critics, and finally, at the end of the gallery, the famous Folios.

There were a few smart-table screens for interactive reading, but these didn’t get much attention from visitors: they merely provided scans of the editions on display for those who wanted to read the plays or the paratext, and this was not as attractive as the display-cases. The only other attempt at new media in the exhibition was a set of projections of actors who had portrayed Shakespearean roles in different centuries, in a small center room where visitors could cast their own dramatic shadows, but I didn’t see anyone hamming it up for the occasion. In general, this was a quiet space for slow walking and reading, where individuals (generally 30 years old and up) mostly came alone and kept to themselves. I went with a friend, and even the two of us usually followed our own routes. Since the exhibition belongs to a library and has the feel of a library, it didn’t seem appropriate to engage in animated discussions or activities. Still, there were definitely some intriguing talking points to bring up, and it was a fun (if staid) visit for two Shakespeare fans.
